Republic day easter egg I had put on flipkart.com homepage. Not the best of the code, FPS could be improved, objects could be reused to avoid garbage collection.

Demo: http://rooplal.github.io/jetplanes/index.html

doodle.init("jet.png");

doodle.destroy() to destroy.

formation.addPlane(x, y, "r, g, b") to add another plane to formation at x,y coordinate with r,g,b smoke
